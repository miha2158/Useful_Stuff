# Generator C# library

This is a library of useful things that I do not really want to write over and over again. _Guess that's what libraries are for, huh_.

Feel free to use this if, for whatever reason, you want to do so. I will _probably_ not document any of this code though. 

This is made mostly for me to see if there's any improvement in my code overtime, as I don't want to look at old projects.
